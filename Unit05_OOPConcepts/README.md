# Unit 5: More on Classes ‚Äì Abstract Classes, Inheritance, and Composition

## üß† Learning Focus

This unit explored more advanced object-oriented programming concepts in Python. Key areas of focus included:
- The use of **constructors** to initialize class attributes
- **Abstract classes** and how they enforce method definitions in subclasses
- **Inheritance** for class specialization
- **Polymorphism** through method overriding
- Object **composition** and **aggregation** to build modular, scalable systems

## üìÅ Artefact Included

### 1. Python Script ‚Äì Vehicle Class Hierarchy
- **File:** `vehicle_hierarchy.py`  
- **Description:** This script demonstrates abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and aggregation using a real-world vehicle system model. A base `Vehicle` abstract class is extended by `Car` and `Motorcycle` classes. Each vehicle contains an `Engine` object (composition), and multiple vehicles are managed inside a `Garage` class (aggregation).

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Created an abstract base class with enforced method contracts using `abc.ABC`
- Demonstrated inheritance and method overriding across vehicle types
- Implemented composition by embedding `Engine` objects inside vehicle classes
- Used aggregation to model a garage containing multiple vehicle instances
- Applied object-oriented modular design for reusability and separation of concerns
