# Unit 8: Data Structures and Data Search in Practice

## üß† Learning Focus

This unit focused on applying Python‚Äôs built-in data structures to solve practical problems. Key concepts explored include:
- The use of **sets** for feature comparison and filtering
- Implementing a **linear search** across object collections
- Demonstrating **polymorphism** through class method overriding
- Using a simple **recursive function** to perform a counting operation

These approaches enhance data processing performance and support modular, scalable software design.

## üìÅ Artefact Included

### 1. Python Script ‚Äì Car Feature Matching System
- **File:** `car_feature_search.py`
- **Description:** This script demonstrates set operations (union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference) using car feature sets. It includes polymorphic method overriding (`describe()`), linear search across car objects, and a recursive function to count common features between two sets. Cars are categorized as `ElectricCar`, `HybridCar`, or standard `Car`, each showcasing inheritance and behavior extension.

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Applied set operations to analyze differences and similarities in data
- Implemented a linear search function across custom objects
- Demonstrated polymorphism via method overriding in subclasses
- Used recursion to count overlapping data between two sets
- Developed an efficient and readable data processing script using core Python data structures
