# Unit 3: Unified Modelling Language (UML)

## üß† Learning Focus
This unit introduced standardized UML diagram types used during the software design process. The goal was to visually model system behavior and architecture before implementation.

Key concepts explored:
- State Machine Diagrams
- Diagram interpretation and construction
- Use of UML at different SDLC stages

## üìÅ Artefacts Included

### 1. State Machine Diagram ‚Äì Washing Machine
- **File:** `washing_machine_state_diagram.png`
- **Description:** Demonstrates the transitions of a washing machine system through states such as Idle, Filling, Washing, Rinsing, and Completed, with events such as Start Button and Time Complete.

### 2. UML in SDLC Summary
- **File:** `uml_in_sdlc.md`
- **Description:** Summarizes how various UML models (use case, class, sequence, state) are used in different phases of the software development life cycle.

### 3. Real-World State Machine Diagram
- **File:** `DFAS-State_Machine_Diagram.pdf`  
- **Description:** A professionally applied UML state machine diagram used to model the lifecycle of a Case Automated Number (CAN) through various automated and manual verification stages. This artefact demonstrates how UML can structure complex system behavior in real-world development environments.

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Applied UML state machine concepts to both academic and real-world systems
- Demonstrated the ability to model object behavior and transitions using UML diagrams
- Recognized how different UML diagrams support various stages of the software development life cycle
- Reflected critically on the importance of designing systems visually before implementation
- Extended
