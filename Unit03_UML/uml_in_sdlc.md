# UML in the Software Development Life Cycle

## Key UML Models in the SDLC

1. **Use Case Diagrams** – Used in requirements analysis to identify actors and functional interactions.
2. **Class Diagrams** – Used in the design phase to define structure.
3. **State Machine Diagrams** – Used to model behavior and system transitions.
4. **Sequence Diagrams** – Helpful during implementation planning to visualize object interaction over time.

These models help bridge the gap between client requirements and working code by visualizing logic before development begins.
