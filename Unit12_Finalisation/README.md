# Unit 12: Working with Design Patterns to Structure Code

## üß† Learning Focus

This unit concluded the module by applying object-oriented design patterns in combination to structure scalable and maintainable systems. It emphasized how multiple design patterns‚Äîwhen paired appropriately‚Äîcan reinforce each other and contribute to efficient code architecture.

Core ideas explored:
- Implementing the Factory Pattern to centralize object creation
- Introducing the Singleton Pattern to manage shared instances
- Structuring code for long-term scalability and resource efficiency
- Recognizing compatible design pattern pairings in practical development

## üìÅ Artefact Included

### 1. Python Script ‚Äì Logger System using Factory + Singleton Patterns
- **File:** `logger_factory.py`
- **Description:** This script combines the Factory and Singleton patterns to create and manage shared logger instances for various channels (File, Console, Email). The `LoggerFactory` ensures that each logger type is instantiated only once, reducing memory usage and enforcing centralized control. The system supports dynamic scaling with minimal code changes, demonstrating pattern synergy and sustainable design.

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Applied the Factory Pattern to abstract object creation
- Used the Singleton Pattern to manage single-instance shared loggers
- Showed how design patterns can be paired for structural efficiency
- Developed a sustainable and extendable logging architecture
- Demonstrated advanced pattern awareness in a real-world context
