# Unit 11: Pointers, References, Memory, and Design Patterns

## üß† Learning Focus

This unit explored key differences between Python and lower-level programming languages in terms of memory handling. While languages like C require explicit pointer and memory management, Python handles memory automatically, supporting sustainable and safe software development. The unit also introduced common object-oriented design patterns that can improve code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

Focus areas included:
- Understanding that Python does not use explicit pointers
- Recognizing memory safety through automatic reference handling
- Applying the **Factory Design Pattern** to create extensible systems
- Appreciating how sustainable code design supports maintainability

## üìÅ Artefact Included

### 1. Python Script ‚Äì Notification System using Factory Pattern
- **File:** `notification_factory.py`
- **Description:** This script implements the Factory design pattern to create different types of notifications (`Email`, `SMS`, `Push`) from a common interface. It uses a factory class to dynamically instantiate the correct type based on input. The script demonstrates modularity, memory-safe object creation, and design sustainability by following solid object-oriented principles.

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Illustrated that Python handles memory efficiently without manual pointers
- Applied abstract classes and interfaces using `abc` module
- Implemented the **Factory Pattern** as a creational design pattern
- Showed how modular and extensible designs improve code sustainability
- Developed clean and testable logic for object instantiation
