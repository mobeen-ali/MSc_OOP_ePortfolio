# Unit 7: Debugging, Error Handling, Data Structures, and Data Search

## üß† Learning Focus

This unit focused on improving code quality and data handling by applying core programming techniques such as debugging, error handling, and the use of data structures and search logic.

Key concepts covered include:
- Identifying and handling common types of runtime errors
- Using linters and return statements to ensure clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Storing structured data using nested dictionaries and lists
- Implementing a linear search algorithm to retrieve specific information

## üìÅ Artefact Included

### 1. Python Script ‚Äì Inventory Search System
- **File:** `inventory_search.py`
- **Description:** This script simulates a simple inventory search system using a nested dictionary. It allows users to search for products by name using a linear search method. The script demonstrates structured data storage, user input handling, exception handling (including specific and generic error types), and return-based modular function design. A `pylint`-related comment is also included to reflect debugging best practices.

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Implemented `try-except` blocks to catch and manage user input and runtime errors
- Created and manipulated nested dictionaries to represent structured inventory data
- Developed a linear search algorithm to identify products by name
- Used modular functions with return statements to promote testable, clean design
- Demonstrated awareness of debugging and linting practices to improve code quality
