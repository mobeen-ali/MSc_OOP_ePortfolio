# Unit 4: UML to Code ‚Äì Applying UML in Practice

## üß† Learning Focus

This unit focused on applying class-based UML design directly to Python code. The key objective was to prepare a class diagram for a real-world system and implement it in an object-oriented way using Python.

The exercise helped reinforce concepts like class relationships, object instantiation, encapsulation, inheritance, and design-driven development.

## üìÅ Artefacts Included

### 1. UML Class Diagram ‚Äì Library System
- **File:** `class_diagram.drawio.png`
- **Description:** A UML class diagram representing the structure of a library, including `Book`, `Member`, `Librarian`, and `Library` classes. Each class includes attributes and methods with visibility markers (`+`, `-`).

### 2. Python Implementation ‚Äì Object-Oriented System
- **File:** `library.py`
- **Description:** Python script implementing the UML class diagram. Features include UUID-based unique IDs for members, librarians, and the library, method overriding, object relationships, and encapsulated data handling.

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Translated a class-based UML model into a complete Python implementation
- Demonstrated understanding of encapsulation, composition, and object relationships
- Modeled real-world entities using classes, attributes, and methods
- Practiced writing clean, modular code based on a predefined design blueprint
