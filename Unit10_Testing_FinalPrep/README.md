# Unit 10: Testing Code in Practice

## üß† Learning Focus

This unit focused on applying testing principles in real-world development contexts. Emphasis was placed on writing reusable, testable code, ensuring stylistic correctness using linting tools, and documenting code effectively to support maintainability.

Key areas explored include:
- Writing and executing unit tests using Python‚Äôs `unittest` module
- Structuring functions for testability and return-based design
- Using comments and PEP 257-compliant docstrings to improve readability
- Ensuring stylistic correctness and clarity using Python linting conventions

## üìÅ Artefacts Included

### 1. Python Script ‚Äì String Utility Module
- **File:** `string_utils.py`
- **Description:** Contains utility functions to reverse strings, count vowels, and convert text to title case. The code is structured using PEP 257-style docstrings and is formatted for linting compatibility.

### 2. Unit Tests ‚Äì String Utility Tests
- **File:** `test_string_utils.py`
- **Description:** Contains test cases for all functions in `string_utils.py` using the built-in `unittest` module. Includes edge cases and expected failures to verify the correctness and robustness of each method.

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Developed testable Python code using clean functional structures
- Documented all functions with complete PEP 257 docstrings
- Applied unit testing principles to validate logic correctness
- Demonstrated awareness of code quality through linting-friendly formatting
- Strengthened code modularity through proper naming and structure
